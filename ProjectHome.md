## ADE7953:  Single Phase Multifunction Metering IC with Neutral Current Measurement ##

Earth leakage is being measured which is particularly usefull for verifying wind turbine and solar inverter leakage in oredr to quickly pinpoint GFI Ground Fault Indicators problems, equipment aging and high frequency earth leakage (induced by chopping power technologies).

_code for Arduino shield or custom embedded_
